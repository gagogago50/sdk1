### OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST [s_OpenOrdersRequest structure] Client >> Server

[Link] - [Top]

This is a message from the Client to the Server requesting the currently open orders.

The Server will send *open/working orders* in response to this request through  ORDER_UPDATE  messages.

The Server will not return  canceled or filled orders.

When the Server responds to this request, it needs to respond with a separate ORDER_UPDATE  for each order.

When the Server responds to this request, OrderUpdateReason in the ORDER_UPDATE message  must be set to **OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST_RESPONSE** indicating the orders are being restated.

If there are no Open orders, the Server will send back 1  ORDER_UPDATE message with only the TotalNumberMessages, MessageNumber, RequestID, OrderUpdateReason, NoOrders = 1 fields set in the ORDER_UPDATE message.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |

| [[int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#int32) **RequestID** | A unique request identifier for this request. |
| [[int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#int32) **RequestAllOrders** | 0 = request a specific order. 1 = for all orders (default). |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **ServerOrderID** | Leave this field empty if Client wants all orders. Otherwise, specify the specific  **ServerServerID** that want  an ORDER_UPDATE message for. |

### ORDER_UPDATE [s_OrderUpdate structure] Server >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

The **ORDER_UPDATE** is a unified message from the Server to the Client which communicates the complete details of an order, the  Order Status,  and the reason for sending the message (OrderUpdateReason).

DTC uses this *single unified* message to provide an update for an order. The  **OrderUpdateReason** field provides a clear indication for each reason this message is being sent.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Type** | The standard message type field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#int32) **RequestID** | Set to 0 unless this is in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST, in which case this must be set to the RequestID given in the OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST.     If this ORDER_UPDATE is unsolicited, for example a real-time fill or other unsolicited order event, the Server must leave this at 0. |
| [[int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#int32) **TotalNumMessages** | This indicates the total number of ORDER_UPDATE  messages when a batch of reports is being sent in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST. If there is only one order being sent, this will be 1. The Server must use a value of 1 for an unsolicited report. A Client should not rely on this field for an unsolicited report. |
| [[int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#int32) **MessageNumber** | This indicates the 1-based index of the ORDER_UPDATE message when a batch of reports is being sent in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST. If there is only one order being sent, this will be 1.  Use a value of 1 for an unsolicited report. A Client should not rely on this field for an unsolicited report. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **Symbol** | The symbol for the order. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **Exchange** | The optional exchange for the symbol. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **PreviousServerOrderID** | Used upon a  Cancel and Replace operation (**ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_COMPLETE**) where a new Server Order identifier is given.     In this case this field needs to be set to the previous Server Order identifier.     This should be left at the default setting of empty in the case where the Server does not change the Server Order identifier upon a Cancel and Replace operation. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **ServerOrderID** | The **ServerOrderID**  is set by the server and uniquely identifies the order.  When a new order is  submitted by the Client and the Server responds with an ORDER_UPDATE, this field needs to be set to the order identifier which is good for the life of the order.     This ServerOrderID can optionally change on a Cancel and Replace operation. In this case, the **PreviousServerOrderID**  field will contain the previous ServerOrderID upon a  **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_COMPLETE** OrderUpdateReason.     **ServerOrderID**  must always be set except it is not required in the cases when the   OrderUpdateReason is one of the following:  **NEW_ORDER_REJECTED**, **ORDER_CANCEL_REJECTED**, **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_REJECTED**. If it is not set, then the **ClientOrderID** must be set. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **ClientOrderID** | The **ClientOrderID** is the order identifier provided by the Client.  When the Client submits a new order, cancels and replaces an existing order, or cancels an order, then the Client needs to specify this identifier.     The Client must maintain the same order identifier throughout the life of the order.     The Server should persist the ClientOrderID across sessions. A *session* is defined as the period of time from the start of the network connection between the Client and Server to the end of that connection.     The Client should only rely upon the ClientOrderID being set when the  OrderUpdateReason is one of the following:   **NEW_ORDER_ACCEPTED**, **NEW_ORDER_REJECTED**, **ORDER_CANCELED**, **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_COMPLETE**, **ORDER_CANCEL_REJECTED**, **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_REJECTED**.     After a new order has been accepted, the Client will rely upon the given **ServerOrderID** from the server to identify the order and should no longer rely upon the given **ClientOrderID**. However,  the Client needs to maintain a copy of the   **ClientOrderID** for any subsequent order modifications and cancellations because this is a required field for those. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **ExchangeOrderID** | The order identifier from the exchange that handles the order. This is optional. |
| [[OrderStatusEnum]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#OrderStatusEnum) **OrderStatus** | This is required. Needs to be set to one of the following values by the Server to indicate the current status of the order, unless **NoneOrder  = 1**:    - **ORDER_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED (0)**: The status of the order is unset. Use this when **NoneOrder  = 1**, or when the Server does not know the true status of an order when the Order Update Report   message is sent. - **ORDER_STATUS_ORDER_SENT (1)**: When a Client sends an order to the Server, then the Client internally will set the status to ORDER_STATUS_ORDER_SENT.  The Server will not set this Status. - **ORDER_STATUS_PENDING_OPEN (2)**: This means the Server has accepted the order but it is not yet considered in a fully working state for any reason. - **ORDER_STATUS_PENDING_CHILD (3)**: This status applies to a Limit or Stop order attached to a parent order. It will have this status if the parent order has not yet filled. - **ORDER_STATUS_OPEN (4)**: Order is open and working. - **ORDER_STATUS_PENDING_CANCEL_REPLACE (5)**: Order is pending a Cancel and Replace operation. The Server should send a ORDER_UPDATE  message with the OrderUpdateReason set to **GENERAL_ORDER_UPDATE** and the OrderStatus set to this status to indicate the pending Cancel and Replace operation. - **ORDER_STATUS_PENDING_CANCEL (6)**: Order is pending a Cancel operation. The Server should send a ORDER_UPDATE  message with the OrderUpdateReason set to **GENERAL_ORDER_UPDATE** and the OrderStatus set to this status to indicate the pending Cancel operation. - **ORDER_STATUS_FILLED (7)**: Order is filled and no longer working. - **ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED (8)**: Order is canceled.  If the user tries to cancel an order that has already been canceled, then continue to return this Order Status for it. - **ORDER_STATUS_REJECTED (9)**: Order has been rejected after the initial order submission. It is not working. - **ORDER_STATUS_PARTIALLY_FILLED (10)**: Order is partially filled and still working. |
| [[OrderUpdateReasonEnum]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#OrderUpdateReasonEnum) **OrderUpdateReason** | This is required. This field needs to be set to one of the following values by the Server to indicate the reason the ORDER_UPDATE is being sent.    - **OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST_RESPONSE (1)**: When the ORDER_UPDATE is specifically sent in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST request, this is the OrderUpdateReason. - **NEW_ORDER_ACCEPTED (2)**: This OrderUpdate indicates a new order has been accepted. - **GENERAL_ORDER_UPDATE (3)**: A general order update.  For example, when an order is in the process of being canceled, the Server may send an ORDER_UPDATE message  with the **OrderStatus** set to **ORDER_STATUS_PENDING_CANCEL**. In this particular case the **OrderUpdateReason** needs to be set to **GENERAL_ORDER_UPDATE (3)**. - **ORDER_FILLED (4)**: Upon a complete fill of the order, this is the  OrderUpdateReason. This OrderUpdateReason must only be used when an ORDER_UPDATE is sent at the moment in time of a fill. A previously filled order that is being restated in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST must not use this OrderUpdateReason. - **ORDER_FILLED_PARTIALLY (5)**:  Upon a partial fill of the order, this is the  OrderUpdateReason. This OrderUpdateReason must only be used when an ORDER_UPDATE is sent at the moment in time of a fill. A previously filled order that is being restated in response to an OPEN_ORDERS_REQUEST must not use this OrderUpdateReason. - **ORDER_CANCELED (6)**: This OrderUpdateReason indicates the order is now successfully canceled. - **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_COMPLETE (7)**: This OrderUpdateReason indicates the order is now successfully canceled and replaced (modified). - **NEW_ORDER_REJECTED (8)**: After an order has been submitted by the Client, it has been rejected for any reason and was never working, the Server will send through an  ORDER_UPDATE with this OrderUpdateReason.  In this case the Server needs to set the **OrderStatus**  in the ORDER_UPDATE to **ORDER_STATUS_REJECTED**.                                                                 The following fields need to be set for a  **NEW_ORDER_REJECTED** OrderUpdateReason: OrderUpdateReason, OrderStatus, MessageNumber, TotalNumMessages, ClientOrderID, Symbol, Exchange, TradeAccount. - **ORDER_CANCEL_REJECTED (9)**: A request  by the Client to cancel the order with the [CANCEL_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_ORDER)  message has been rejected.                                                                   The current status of the order must be set in the **OrderStatus** member of the ORDER_UPDATE message.                                                                 In the case where the given **ServerOrderID** in a  [CANCEL_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_ORDER) message from the Client is not known, then respond with an ORDER_UPDATE message and set the **OrderUpdateReason** to **ORDER_CANCEL_REJECTED**  and set the **OrderStatus** to **ORDER_STATUS_REJECTED**.                                                                  In the case where the **ServerOrderID** is not known, then in the ORDER_UPDATE  message,  it should not be set.  However,  in this case it is necessary to set the **ClientOrderID** in the ORDER_UPDATE message to the given **ClientOrderID** in the [CANCEL_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_ORDER) message. The  **ClientOrderID**  must always be set in this case in an ORDER_UPDATE.                                                                  In the case where the order has already been canceled for the given **ServerOrderID** in a  [CANCEL_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_ORDER) message, then respond with an ORDER_UPDATE message and set the **OrderUpdateReason** to **ORDER_CANCEL_REJECTED**  and set the **OrderStatus** to **ORDER_STATUS_CANCELED**.                                                                 If for some reason the Server is uncertain as to the status  of the order that was attempted to be canceled, then set the **OrderStatus** to **ORDER_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED**. - **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_REJECTED (10)**: A request  by the Client to cancel and replace the order with the [CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER)  message has been rejected.                                                                    The current status of the order must be set in the **OrderStatus** member of the ORDER_UPDATE message.                                                                 In the case where the given **ServerOrderID** in a [CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER) message from the Client is not known, then respond with an ORDER_UPDATE message and set the **OrderUpdateReason** to **ORDER_CANCEL_REPLACE_REJECTED**  and set the **OrderStatus** to **ORDER_STATUS_REJECTED**.                                                                  In the case where the **ServerOrderID** is not known, then in the ORDER_UPDATE  message,  it should not be set.  However,  in this case it is necessary to set the **ClientOrderID** in the ORDER_UPDATE message to the given **ClientOrderID** in the [CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_OrderEntryModificationMessages.php#Messages-CANCEL_REPLACE_ORDER) message.

If **NumberOfDays**  and  **StartDateTime** are both not set or 0, the Server needs to reject the request. |
| [[t_DateTime]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#t_DateTime) **StartDateTime** | The **NumberOfDays** field is ignored by the Server when **StartDateTime** is set.     The **StartDateTime** field specifies to the Server to return order fills starting with the Date-Time specified.     If **NumberOfDays**  and  **StartDateTime** are both not set or 0, the Server needs to reject the request.     This field must be specified as an integer. It is a UNIX time value in seconds. In the case of Sierra Chart, it can also be specified as a UNIX time value in microseconds.  If specifying microseconds the minimum  time value is 2010-1-1 00:00 UTC.  Any time value earlier than this  will be interpreted as seconds. |
