It is important to be aware of [Market Data Restrictions](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCServer.php#Restrictions), before implementing the use of these messages.

---

### MARKET_DATA_FEED_STATUS [s_MarketDataFeedStatus structure] Server  >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

The **MARKET_DATA_FEED_STATUS**  message is an optional message sent by the Server to indicate the overall status of the market data feed. This status applies to all  symbols that have been subscribed to for market data.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Type** | The standard message type field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[MarketDataFeedStatusEnum]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#MarketDataFeedStatusEnum) **Status** | This can be set to **MARKET_DATA_FEED_UNAVAILABLE**, to indicate the market data feed is presently not available. Or it can be set to **MARKET_DATA_FEED_AVAILABLE**, to indicate the market data feed has been restored.     Upon a connection to the server, **MARKET_DATA_FEED_AVAILABLE** is assumed to be the status.  It is not until there has been expressly given **MARKET_DATA_FEED_UNAVAILABLE**, will the data feed be considered lost. |

### MARKET_DATA_FEED_SYMBOL_STATUS [s_MarketDataFeed SymbolStatus structure] Server  >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

The **MARKET_DATA_FEED_SYMBOL_STATUS** message is an optional message sent by the Server to indicate status of the market data feed for a particular symbol.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Type** | The standard message type field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[MarketDataFeedStatusEnum]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#MarketDataFeedStatusEnum) **Status** | This can be set to **MARKET_DATA_FEED_UNAVAILABLE**, to indicate the market data feed is presently not available for the symbol. Or it can be set to **MARKET_DATA_FEED_AVAILABLE**, to indicate the market data feed has been restored for the symbol.     Upon a connection to the server, **MARKET_DATA_FEED_AVAILABLE** is assumed to be the status.  It is not until there has been expressly given **MARKET_DATA_FEED_UNAVAILABLE**, will the market data feed for the symbol be considered lost. |
| [[unsigned int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int32) **SymbolID** | This is the same SymbolID sent by the Client in the MARKET_DATA_REQUEST message which corresponds to the  Symbol that the status in this message is for. |

### MARKET_DATA_REQUEST [s_MarketDataRequest structure] Client >> Server

[Link] - [Top]

The MARKET_DATA_REQUEST  message will subscribe to market data for a particular Symbol or request a market data snapshot.

The Server  can also send market depth data in response to this message and not require a MARKET_DEPTH_REQUEST.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Type** | The standard message type field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[RequestActionEnum]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#RequestActionEnum) **RequestAction** | This needs to be set to **SUBSCRIBE**  to subscribe to market data for the Symbol from the Server. The Server will respond with an initial MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT message and then provide **MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_*** updates as necessary.     To unsubscribe, use  **UNSUBSCRIBE**.     To request only a  MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT message, set this to **SNAPSHOT**. |
| [[unsigned int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int32) **SymbolID** | This is the identifier which will be used in all of the market data response messages. This identifier is used so that the **Symbol** and  **Exchange**  do not have to be passed back  in response messages from the Server.   This makes the market data feed bandwidth efficient.     If the Server receives a MARKET_DATA_REQUEST for a Symbol and Exchange to subscribe to data for, that is currently subscribed to and this SymbolID is different, then the Server needs to reject it. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **Symbol** | The Symbol that market data is requested for. Not set when unsubscribing. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **Exchange** | Optional Exchange. Not set when unsubscribing. |

### MARKET_DATA_REJECT [s_MarketDataReject structure] Server >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

The MARKET_DATA_REJECT  message is sent by the Server to the Client to reject a MARKET_DATA_REQUEST message for any reason.

| Field Name | Field Description |
| --- | --- |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Size** | The standard message size field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int16]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int16) **Type** | The standard message type field. Automatically set by constructor. |
| [[unsigned int32]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#unsigned_int32) **SymbolID** | This is the same SymbolID sent by the Client in the MARKET_DATA_REQUEST message which corresponds to the  Symbol that the data in this message is for. |
| [[char]](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessageDocumentation.php#char) **RejectText** | Free-form text explaining the reason for the reject. |

### MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT [s_MarketDataSnapshot structure] Server >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

The Server sends the MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT  message to the Client immediately after a successful MARKET_DATA_REQUEST  message has been received from the Client and it has indicated to subscribe to the symbol or requested the snapshot of data.

Any changes to the data fields within the **MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT**  message during the trading session will be sent by the Server to the Client through the corresponding **MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_*** messages.

It is recommended that the **MARKET_DATA_SNAPSHOT** be sent by the Server at the start of a new trading session.

This message can be sent more often, however it is not intended to be sent frequently.

This message type does not signify a trade has occurred.  It should never be interpreted by the Client in that way.

There is no need to send this when there is a new High or Low during the trading session. The Server should use the MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_SESSION_HIGH or  MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_SESSION_LOW messages instead.

This message is optional.

Sent by the Server to the Client  when there is an update to the Bid Ask prices  and/or quantities.  This message  is identical to the MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_BID_ASK message   except it does not have a timestamp.  It needs to be sent when there is no change with the timestamp for the Bid Ask update as compared to the prior  update.

When the Server sends this message to the Client, the Client needs to use the prior received  Bid Ask update timestamp  to know what the timestamp is for this message.

### MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_SESSION_VOLUME [s_MarketDataUpdateSessionVolume structure] Server >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

Sent by the Server to the Client when the session trade Volume needs to be updated.

The recommended rule for the Server to notify the Client of a change with the session trade volume to maintain bandwidth efficiency, is as follows: When a trade occurs for a symbol subscribed to, the Server will send a MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_TRADE message to the Client. The Client should then increment its session trade volume value for the symbol  by the value in the **Volume** field in this message.

The Server will assume the Client is doing this. Therefore, when a trade occurs and the session trade volume does not equal the prior session trade volume plus the Volume  for the most recent trade sent to the Client, then the Server must send out a **MARKET_DATA_UPDATE_SESSION_VOLUME** message to the client since the client calculation of the session trade volume is no longer correct.

It is assumed that the reason for this inconsistency is due to trades included within the session trade volume which have not been sent out as normal trades.

The Server should also send this message out at the frequency that the Server determines, such as every minute if there also has been a trade at that time.

This is a message sent by Server to provide the initial market depth data entries to the Client after the  Client subscribes to market data or separately subscribes to market depth data. The Client will need to separately subscribe to market depth data if the Server requires it.

Each message provides a single entry of depth data. Therefore, the Server will send multiple **MARKET_DEPTH_SNAPSHOT_LEVEL** messages in a series in order for the Client to build up its initial market depth book.

The first message will be identified by the **IsFirstMessageInBatch**  field being set to 1. The last message will be identified by the **IsLastMessageInBatch**  field being set to 1.

In the case where the market depth book is empty, the Server still needs to send through one single message with the **SymbolID** set, **IsFirstMessageInBatch** equal to 1 and **IsLastMessageInBatch** equal to 1. All other members will be at the default values. The  Client will understand this as an empty book.

### MARKET_DEPTH_UPDATE_LEVEL [s_MarketDepthUpdateLevel structure] Server >> Client

[Link] - [Top]

Sent by the Server to the Client to  **Update/Insert** or **Delete** a particular market depth price level in the market depth book maintained by the Client.

Each **MARKET_DEPTH_UPDATE_LEVEL** message updates one level of market depth on one side. An insert/update/delete model is used for market depth.

The Client will need to determine the based upon the price, what particular market depth level is being updated, inserted or deleted.

It is for this reason, that an insert/update is considered as one update type since it is possible to determine whether it is an insert or update based upon the existence of the price level in the existing market depth book on the Client side.

What this means is that when the **UpdateType**  field is **MARKET_DEPTH_INSERT_UPDATE_LEVEL**, it is considered an insert if the price level is not found on the particular side of the  market depth being updated. It is considered an update, if the price level is found on the particular side of market depth being updated.

This message uses  a double datatype for the  **Price** field. 	There is no level index.  It is the responsibility of the  Client to determine where in its market depth array it is maintaining  where the insert/update/delete operation needs to occur.

Since floating-point comparisons are not always precise, there should be a comparison made only to the number of decimal places the symbol  specifies in its security definition. This can be determined through the [SECURITY_DEFINITION_RESPONSE::PriceDisplayFormat](https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/DTCMessages_SymbolDiscoverySecurityDefinitionsMessages.php#Messages-SECURITY_DEFINITION_RESPONSE) field.
